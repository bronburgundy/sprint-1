Command line: It's like the matrix - everything you see on your computer or the web or in an app is made up of text (or code), and command line is the tool that lets you create and change it.

Commands:
pwd = tells you what directory (or folder) you're currently in in the filesystem
ls = lists your files and directories of the current directory you're in
ls -a = lists your files in a directory - including hidden ones
cd = changes you to a different sub directory
mk dir = makes a new directory or folder
touch = makes a new file inside the directory
cp = copies a file or directory
mv = moves a file or directory somewhere else
rm = deletes a file
rm -r = deletes a directory and all its contents
